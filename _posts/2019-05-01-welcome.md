title: Welcome to my blog !

Welcome ! This is my first post so let me present myself briefly...

## Who am I ?
I am CÃ©dric Bouysset, a PhD student at the Institute of Chemistry of Nice, in the south of France.  
My research projects tackle taste perception (and sometimes olfaction) using computational approaches.  
My day-to-day work includes homology modeling of bitter taste receptors, building machine-learning models to predict gustative properties from chemical structures, writing Python or Bash scripts, and a bit of teaching for bachelor students.

## What is this blog for ?
I will probably post news/articles that I find interesting, code snippets and short tutorials here.

## What activities do I enjoy ?
I like programing, playing video-games and badminton with friends, and snowboarding.  
Oh and beer... I really like beer :beer:

I hope you find this blog useful !

Cedric
